# FinalProject
For my final project I will be writing a paper discussing the history of Linux as well as some of the pros and cons of Linux’s distributions.  

The objective for this project is to be informational in the history of Linux. Documenting their beginning in the 90s and their growth and legacy into today. As well as Picking three different Linux distributions and distributions and discussing the pros and cons of each.  

My deliverables for this Project will be an MLA formatted paper giving a thorough history into the open-source operating system that is Linux. I will discuss their inception in 1991 as well as their advancements, achievements and the impact they have had on modern day coding. The rest of my paper will be centered around three different Linux distributions and the pros and cons of each. The three distributions I will be discussing as of now (these might change) are UBUNTU, Fedora, and Debian. Some of the pros and cons I will be discussing are their user-friendliness, stability and security and impact.
